# Goal : 
solve some puzzles from the <a href="https://www.codingame.com/home">CodinGame</a> WebSite 
- to improve my skills in programming 
- to learn new stuff like algorithms etc ...
# Don 't Cheat :  
Copy Paste the code to get some XP is just ridiculous. 
you need to solve it alone. since your goal is to improve your programming skills  
don't be Lazy, and solve it by your own. 
i just wanna share my way of solving these problems with you. it may be useful if you want to learn from it.
